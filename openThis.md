Dear Friend,

Welcome to the wonders of the command line.

I wish you well in your digital exploits; may the bits be ever in your favor.

Love Yoh

1. So we can share this Amazon instance. It only costs like 5 - 10 bucks a month to keep running; (when you shut it down there is no data permanence)

2. the permanence problem can be solved by uploading files to github. The instance comes with it (i think) or I installed it at some point. Anyhow under the parent folder make a subfolder w/ your name (no i wont tell you how; it's in the book xD) 
3. something...
